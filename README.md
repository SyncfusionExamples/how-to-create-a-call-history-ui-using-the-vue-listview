# How to Create a Call History UI Using the Vue ListView 
A quick-start React app that shows how to customize Syncfusion React List view items with icons or images using the template property. Learn how to effectively use:
- headerTemplate
- template
- groupHeaderTemplate

  
to create a call history interface.

The Vue ListView component is a list-like interface that allows you to select an item or multiple items. It represents data in an interactive hierarchical structure across different layouts or views which supports UI virtualization to improve performance while loading huge amounts of data. This creates a fixed number of items regardless of data volume and displays the relevant data instead of creating all items simultaneously.
